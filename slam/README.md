# SLAM - Simultaneous localization & mapping

<p>Slam is used to predict the dynamic motion path of a moving platform based on the location coordinates and the precisie mapping of a physical environment</p>

## What will SLAM be used for?
 - Slam will be used to take the 2D driving space into a 3D driving space
 - Ultilize a single camera to create a psuedo lidar in order achieve a more precise description of the state space.
